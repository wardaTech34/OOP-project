2. Follow prompts to create a bank account.  
3. Deposit, withdraw, or check balance using the program menu.  

## Purpose
This project helps beginners **understand the core principles of OOP** by simulating real-world bank transactions. It shows how to manage data securely within objects and how to structure code using classes and methods.
